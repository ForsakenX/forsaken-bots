forsaken-bots
=============

Various bots used by the Forsaken community.

  FsknBot:

      Used in #forsaken @ irc.freenode.net.

      This bot provides a number of handy plugins we frequently use.

      Also runs a daemon which game hosts send beacons to notify the world of their game.

  SkypeBot:

      Dialing this bot would auto join you to a conference.

      This provided voice chat for games without need for someone to manage it during game play.

  IrcProxy:
  
      Hides multiple irc clients behind one active session.
  
      Allowed multiple bots to sit behind one login and reduced spamming the channel with joins/leaves.
